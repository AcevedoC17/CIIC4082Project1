To build src:

cd src
cl65 main.s --verbose --target nes -o bin/main.nes

Then run .nes file located in bin folder using FCEUX


FCEUX bug known: If booted in new PPU mode, it will not work. FCEUX must be booted in old PPU mode then switched to new PPU in order to work.


Bugs:
    When Satrina reaches the right side of the screen, she is flipped to move to the left. Known fix.
    When jumping, Satrina briefly clips through the floor.
    When colliding with the edge of the screen, Satrina jitters. NOTE: This jitter is cause by the forced flip at the edge. Will be removed next commit.
